This is a demo project for rendering different 3d Figures
Everything is done using __glfw__ and __glm__

As inspiration, i used [this tutorial](http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_cylinder.html), which i rewrited and added one more figure.

Used only __ambient__ and __diffuse__ direct light, because this is not lighting demo;

Currently demo has only two figures:
- Cylinder
- Sphere

To change between them use your keyboard:
- 1 - sphere
- 2 - cylinder

Camera can be used using mouse and WASD.
